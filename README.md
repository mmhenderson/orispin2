# orispin2
Spatial working memory task with random and predictable responses. 

## ExptScripts
- Code to generate stimulus sequences for fMRI experiments. Includes main task as well as all localizers.
## Preprocessing
- Code to do all data preprocessing, ROI identification, and trial epoching.
## Analysis
- Code to reproduce all main analyses of behavior as well as fMRI data. Also includes additional analyses not included in our paper.
## Notes
- In all code here, subjects 2-7 correspond to the 6 subjects included in the final analyses. Subject 1 participated in an early pilot version of the experiment and did not complete the final version of the experiment.
- This code also does preprocessing and some initial analysis for ROIs in the Multiple-Demand network, which we did not analyze or incldue in our paper.
